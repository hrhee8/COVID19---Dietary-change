# COVID19---Dietary-change

### Background

One of the major difference that the people are experiencing is the diet. The way people are eating has changed ever since. 
The restrictions that people were given prevented people from dining outside and started to consume food in home more. 
Additional to such phenomenon, exploring the changes toward the dietary patterns of people is what was concerning to me.

The data was collected from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset
