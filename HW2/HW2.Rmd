## Problem 1
```{r}
indicators <- read.table('indicators.txt', header = TRUE)
#head(indicators)
```
```{r}
summary(indicators)
```

```{r}
price <- lm(PriceChange ~ LoanPaymentsOverdue, indicators)
summary(price)
```

###Problem 1 a)

```{r}
summary(price)$r.squared
summary(price)$adj.r.squared
```
R squared value shows that there is 27.9% of the data that fits the regression model. The adjusted R squared shows a smaller value because it takes consideration of the predictors into the value, having 23.4% of the data fitting to the regression model.

###Problem 1 b)

```{r}
slope <- summary(price)$coef
slope[2,1]
confint(price, 'LoanPaymentsOverdue', level=0.95)
```
There is an evidence of a significant negative linear association, with 95% confidence interval showing negative numbers.

###Problem 1 c)

```{r}
(predict(price, data.frame(LoanPaymentsOverdue = 4), interval="confidence"))
```
0% is not feasible because 0 is not in the 95% confidence interval.


##Problem 2

```{r}
library(faraway)
data(sat)
head(sat)
```
###Problem 2 a)
```{r}
score <- lm(total ~ expend+ratio+salary, data = sat)
summary(score)
```

###Problem 2 b)

Suppose that $\alpha = 0.05$. For the hypothesis of $H_0 : \beta_{salary} = 0$, because the p value is $0.0667$, $0.0667 > 0.05$. This shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning we can consider $\beta_{salary} = 0$.

###Problem 2 c)
$H_0 : \beta_{salary} = \beta_{ratio} = \beta_{expend} = 0$. Suppose that $\alpha = 0.05$. The following hypothesis could be tested with F statistic, which shows a p value of $0.01209$. Because $0.01209 < 0.05$, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there are predictors that have effect on the response.

###Problem 2 d)

```{r}
score_d <- lm(total ~ expend+ratio+salary+takers, data = sat)
summary(score_d)
```
Suppose that $\alpha = 0.05$. For the hypothesis of $H_0 : \beta_{takers} = 0$, because the p value is $2.61e^{-16}$, $2.61e^{-16} < 0.05$. This shows that we reject the null hypothesis. Moreover, considering the F test, because the p value for the F test is $2.2e^{-16}} meaning we can consider that the model with takers have predictors that affects the response. Also the p value is smaller than the previous model, which means that this fits better.


##Problem 3

###Problem 3 a)
```{r}
data(prostate)
prob3 <- lm(lpsa ~ ., data = prostate)
summary(prob3)
confint(prob3, c("age"), .95)
confint(prob3, c("age"), .90)
```
The confidence interval for age shows that when the interval is 90%, it does not include 0, which means that age is significant, whereas when the interval is 95%, it does include 0 meaning that it is may not be significant.
For the hypothesis testing for $H_0 : \beta_{age} = 0$, when $\alpha = 0.05$, the p value, which is $0.08229$ is greater than $\alpha$, meaning that it fails to reject the null hypothesis. 

###Problem 2 b)
```{r}
prob3_2 <- update(prob3, . ~ lcavol + lweight + svi)
anova(prob3, prob3_2)
```
THe null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_{age} = 0$ Because the p value of the anova analysis is 0.2167, which is greater than 0.05, this tells that reduced model is not significantly better than the original model. Therefore, the original model with all the predictors is preferred.

###Problem 2 c)
```{r}
library(ellipse)
plot(ellipse(prob3, c('age', 'lbph')), type = "l")
points(0, 0, pch = 2)
abline(v= confint(prob3)['age',], lty = 2)
abline(h= confint(prob3)['lbph',], lty = 2)
```
The joint null hypothesis is $H_0 : \beta_{age} = \beta_{lbph} = 0$. It fails to reject the null hypothesis because the origin is inside the confidence region. With the same reason, when the null hypothesis are $H_0 : \beta_{age} = 0$ or $H_0 : \beta_{lbph} = 0$, they both fail to reject because 0 is inside the 95% confidence region.

###Problem 3 d)

```{r}
n.iter = 5000; 
tt = numeric(n.iter);
for(i in 1:n.iter){
    newprostate=prostate;
    newprostate[,c(3)]=prostate[sample(97),c(3)];
    ge = lm(lpsa ~., data=newprostate);
    tt[i] = summary(ge)$coef[4,3]
}
#Estimated p-value
length(abs(tt[abs(tt) > abs(summary(prob3)$coef[4,3])]))/n.iter
```
The p value for age is 0.08229. The permutation of the t value shows that the estimated p value is getting closer to the value of 0.08229 as the number of iteration increases.

## Problem 4

###Problem 4 a)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(fat)
View(fat)
fat <-  select(fat, age, weight, height, neck, chest,
                abdom, hip, thigh, knee, ankle, 
                biceps, forearm, wrist, brozek)
modelf <-  lm(brozek ~ ., data = fat)
```
```{r}
modelf1 <- lm(brozek ~ chest + abdom, data = fat)
summary(modelf1)
```
For the null hypothesis, F test should be looked. The p value for the f test is almost equal to zero. This means that we reject the null hypothesis that $H_0 : \beta_{chest} = \beta_{abdom}$.

###Problem 4 b)
```{r}
modelf2 <- lm(brozek ~ age + weight + height + abdom, data = fat)
anova(modelf, modelf2)
```
The anova test shows that the p value is 0.002558. This shows that the reduced model is not significantly better than the original model.

###Problem 4 c)

```{r}
medianvalue=apply(fat,2,median)
x=data.frame(t(medianvalue))

predict.lm(modelf, newdata = x, interval = "prediction")
predict.lm(modelf2, newdata = x, interval = "prediction")
```
The intervals are almost the same, so they do not differ an important amount.

###Problem 4 d)
```{r}
fatd <- fat[25:50,c(1,2,3,6)]
predict(modelf2, new=data.frame(fatd), interval="prediction")
```
47 and 50 includes 0 in their intervals with even a possibility of having negative fat. These two data points could be considered as anomalous.

###Problem 4 e)

```{r}
fate <- fat[c(25:46, 48, 49),]
predict(modelf2, new=data.frame(fate), interval="prediction")
medianvalue2=apply(fate,2,median)
y=data.frame(t(medianvalue2))

predict.lm(modelf, newdata = y, interval = "prediction")
predict.lm(modelf2, newdata = y, interval = "prediction")
```
It changed the lower and upper bound of the interval. But the difference is not huge.
