```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(faraway)
data(prostate)
```

Problem 1 a
```{r}
library(faraway)
data(prostate)
summary(prostate)
```

Above result are the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, maximum of the data. As it is shown in the summary, svi and gleason shows a categorical data. Whereas other continuous variables show good range of distribution of the data. Age and pgg45 could be categorized as discrete variable. 

Problem 1 b
```{r}
prostate$gleason <- factor(prostate$gleason)
prostate$svi <- factor(prostate$svi)
summary(prostate)
```

By using factor it became clearer for svi and gleason to be categorized into number of occurence in the data.

Problem 1 c
```{r}
hist(prostate$lcavol)
hist(prostate$lpsa)
hist(prostate$lbph)
hist(prostate$lcp)
```
Histogram for lcavol and lpsa seems to have a normal distribution although futher analysis is required. The remaining three are skewed to the left.

Problem 1 d
```{r}
plot(lpsa ~ svi, prostate)
```
Because the plot is with categorical variable the plot looks abnormal and hard to analyze. But there seems to be a difference in the mean of lpsa with depending on svi.


Problem 1 e
```{r}
plot(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate)
abline(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate))
```
This plot seems to show that there might be linear relationship between lpsa and lcavol. Further analysis is required to check it.


Problem 2 a
```{r}
a = lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate)
plot(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate)
abline(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate))
summary(a)$coef
```
The slope is 0.7193 and the intercept is 1.50729. This regression shows that there is a linear relationship between the two.

Problem 2 b
```{r}
a = lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate)
summary(a)
```
The residual standard error is 0.7875 with R squared value of 0.5394. The R squared value shows that it shows 53 percentage variation.

Problem 2 c
```{r}
mean(resid(a))
median(resid(a))
```

Problem 2 d
```{r}
plot(predict(a),resid(a))
```
The fitted vs residual plot shows that there is a constant variance in the data.

Problem 2 e
```{r}
plot(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate)
abline(lm(lpsa ~ lcavol, prostate))
abline(lm(lcavol~lpsa,prostate))
```
The two lines do not intersect.
